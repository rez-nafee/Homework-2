Scheduling trains that use the same railway is a tough, yet important, problem to solve when it comes to transportation. One train being even several minutes off can lead to a butterfly effect of congestion, delays, and many frustrated passengers. It can also be hazardous if two trains are mistakenly scheduled to arrive on the same track at the same time. Assuming that there are no delays and all trains arrive and depart on time, your job is to implement an interface to interact with all trains in the same station in the form of a linked list. A Station will contain a list of Tracks, and each Track will contain a list of Trains. Linked lists are efficient in these types of situations because the list can be easily modified without changing the whole structure of the existing list.
